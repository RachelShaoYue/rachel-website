		<h2>Dumplings</h2>
		<p>On every Winter Solstice, dumpling restaurants are overflowing with customers because there's an old belief that if you are not eating dumplings on the day, your ears will be bitten off by the freezing weather. Many Chinese people either go out to have, make, or order dumplings for their gatherings. Regardless of the reason, it brings friends and families together.</p>

		<h2>Red Underwear</h2>

		<p>Chinese people either voluntarily or being forced to wear red underwear on Ben Ming Nian (one's Chinese Zodiac birth year) because it's believed that wearing red underwear during the whole year helps prevent misfortunes from happening to them. That is because the legend says that their Zodiac animal is on duty in heaven, and it can't protect its people from troubles.</p>

		<h2>Death Clock</h2>
		<p>In China, people do not give a clock to one another as a gift, because they have a superstition about it because of the phrase- "giving a clock"- being a homophone. The line sounds like another phrase that means "looking after a dying person" or "burying a person."</p>
