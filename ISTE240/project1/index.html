		<p>In 2001, I was born in China, and when I was two years old, I was found at the gate of Nanyang City Social Welfare Institute, an orphanage in Nanyang, without any information of who my birth family was and of my personal information. I stayed in the orphanage for about two years. After that, my family adopted me, and we flew to the United States when I was four years in 2005.</p>

		<h2>Why Nanyang?</h2>

		<figure class="img_on_right"><img src="assets/media/henan_map.jpg" alt="Map of Henan"><figcaption><a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/">Map of Henan; Nanyang is southwest from the Capital</a></figcaption></figure>
		<p>Nanyang is a city with a rich history in southwestern Henan in China. Since I briefly lived at the orphanage in Nanyang, I would like to revisit the city someday and get to know the city better. I wanted to research the city and to learn the Chinese culture better beforehand to prepare myself for making a trip in the future. This site is informative about Nanyang, including places to visit and a short history of the city. However, the Chinese culture is included as well, and it's always a good idea to understand the culture better a bit before visiting Nanyang. This website is also for you if you are interested in gaining more knowledge of China's unique culture and what kind of city Nanyang is.</p>
