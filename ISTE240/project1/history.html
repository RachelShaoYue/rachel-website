		<p>Four or five hundred thousand years ago, the Nanzhao people started growing their generations in Nanyang. During the Warring States period, Nanyang became well known for its smelting center in China. Later, the prosperity of the city raised during the Western Han Dynasty as its economy grew. In the Eastern Han Dynasty, many outstanding strategists, business saints, and scientists (including Medical Saint Zhang Zhongjing and the Military Marquise Zhuge Liang) were born in Nanyang. They brought honor to the city for several generations.  Eventually, its fame declined, and it became a county town until the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949. It became the political and cultural center of Henan and the place of trading crops. Since the 1980s, the factories and industries in Nanyanghave been thriving with goods.</p>
