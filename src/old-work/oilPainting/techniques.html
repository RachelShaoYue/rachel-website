		<h2>Three Techniques</h2>
		<p>Here are the three techniques are shown below. They are helpful to create a better result when you paint your artwork. You are very welcome to explore other techniques to experiment with. Maybe you would find some new techniques that you create by yourself when you experiment with the medium. The number of existed techniques is growing as time passes by.</p>

		<p>If you are a drawing artist, holding a paintbrush the same way as you would sketch your artwork. Grip your oil painting brush at the end of its handle. This will let you paint with your whole arm, not just moving your wrist. Only moving your wrist is only good if you paint small details. Moving your arm gives you a wider field for movements to paint and a better sense of proportion of an object. The video above shows you how you should hold your paintbrush.</p>
		<h2>Mixing Oil Paints</h2>

		<p>You could use your paintbrush to mix oil colors, but in that way, you could waste too much of oil paints because they would be absorbed into the difficult to reach part of the paintbrushes. Therefore, palette knives are useful; they are wonderful tools to have to mix oil colors and minimize the waste of oil paints.</p>
        <p>Before you go ahead mixing oil paints. You should be aware of some purposes of some oil colors. For example, white is to neutralize or reduce the richness of colors. Yellow is mainly used to make colors more vibrant. Don't mix black with colors to make them darker unless you want to turn colors into much duller and darker colors. Instead, you are recommended to use dark blue or brown to reduce the value of colors. You should always experiment with mixing various colors to get to know how you can manipulate colors better. However, for better results, you should just mix up to two colors, excluding white.</p>
		<h2>Brushstrokes in Oils</h2>

		<p>There is a wide variety of brushstrokes that will make the specified effects you want. They are sufficient to create texture look to your oil painting especially if you paint a landscape because it has a lot of different textures other than just a smooth texture. The helpful demos are in the video above. In most cases, you should start painting from the most background to objects in the front, because when you paint, you would notice how easily it can accidentally overlap an object in the background. It's nearly impossible to paint on the edge of an object precisely without leaving any missing spot.</p>
