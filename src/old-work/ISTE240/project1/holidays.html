		<p>Chinese New Year is also known as Lunar New Year and Spring Festival. The date of this holiday changes every year since it is based on the Chinese lunar calendar, but the day is always on the first day of the new moon after the winter solstice.</p>
		<p>On Chinese New Year Eve, people gather to have dinner with their families, which is the most significant part of the day. On Chinese New Year, people have traditions of putting up decorations, giving red envelopes and gifts, and watching lion and dragon dances. They also either watch or set off fireworks on that day.</p>
		<p>The next date for the Chinese New year is on Tuesday, February 1st in 2022.</p>

		<p>This festival is also known as Duanwu Festival. This holiday also follows the lunar calendar, so its date also varies for every year. It is a day of remembrance for Qu Yuan, Wu Zixu, and Cao E. It is also an event for athletes; it features dragon boat racing. The origin of the event is believed to be from the legend of people looking for the body of Qu Yuan, who drowned himself in the Miluo River, by paddling on boats. They couldn't find him. To honor him, some people beat drums and paddle out in boats.</p>
		<p>In China, many different places host dragon boat races for athletes to participate in on the holiday. Also, some Chinese people celebrate the holiday by eating sticky rice dumplings, hanging Chinese aromatic leaves, drinking realgar wine, and wearing perfume pouches, but those old customs are dying since they do them out of fear of superstitions.</p>
		<p>In 2022, Dragon Boat Festival is on Friday, June 3.</p>

		<h2>Qingming Festival</h2>

		<p>Qingming Festival is also known as Tomb Sweeping or Pure Brightness. The festival falls on the 15th day after the Spring Equinox. The festival started in the Zhou Dynasty when there were many expensive ceremonies in which many ancient emperors from the period of a few thousand years were buried. Later in 732, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty declared that people should formally pay respect and honor ancestors' graves on the first day of the Qingming solar term.</p>
		<p>On the holiday, people in China visit their ancestors' graves and offer food, burn incense, or offer joss paper that represents money to pay their respect. They also sweep and clean off weeds around the graves, and then they sometimes leave some plants on the tomb. There are other activities that some people do for the festival, including going out to enjoy the spring season, kite flying, and eating cold food with their gatherings.</p>
		<p>In 2022, the festival falls on Tuesday, April 5th.</p>
