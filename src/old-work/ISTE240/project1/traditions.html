		<h2>Collective Society</h2>
		<p>The Chinese society is collective, and people's actions reflect their affiliated groups' reputations. People are conscious of their deeds and careful not to cause any public embarrassment or inflict on their family or group. Their philosophy is based on Confucious that emphasizes maintaining a stable society with social and familial relations. It has a hierarchy-father to son, older child to young sibling, husband to wife, and ruler to society.</p>

		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>Honoring family relationships is extremely important in China, and in the Confucian belief, family is the foundation for building relationships in society. It is common for close and distant relatives to live together under the same roof. Children often remain close to their family in their adulthood and often make regular visits to the family as a priority.</p>

		<h2>Mianzi</h2>
		<p>Since they have to maintain a sense of harmony, they follow the concept of a face that is called Mianzi. The concept focuses on the importance of having honor and a good reputation and showing respect.</p>
		<p>There are four types of Mianzi face.<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Losing face by exposing one's wrongful actions</li>
			<li>Giving face by showing respect to another one</li>
			<li>Saving face by avoiding mistakes and showing wisdom in action</li>
			<li>Gaining face by receiving compliments</li>
		</ul>
