		<h2>After Painting</h2>
		<p>Although oil paints are drying rather slowly, it's recommended that you clean materials if needed and your skin where is contacted with oil paints shortly after you finish painting. Once oil paints become dried, they are difficult to remove. Turpentine is a good paint thinner to clean all materials.</p><p>When you finish painting for the day, leave your painting on the easel or put it on a folded piece of newspaper on a shelf to prevent oil from touching the shelf. Don't leave it in front of the window where the sun is radiating because it can ruin the painting, causing it to crisp and peel.</p>

		<h2>Painting Brushes</h2>
		<p>Before you start to wash painting brushes, pour some turpentine into a glass bottle that a brush can fit in, because it can be reused. Don't fill the bottle. The first step is to pinch and wipe off a chunk of each painting brush with a towel. Then, dip a painting brush into the bottle of paint thinner, and push and squeeze it against the side of the bottle to get extra paint off. Left the brush above the liquid and then shake it a bit to let the extra liquid to drip. Then, squeeze and wipe it off with a towel, and repeat the steps a few times until paints are gone from the painting brushes. After that, wash them with water and soap, and then shape them to their original shape and dry them with a towel. Drying on their own can be bad for them. Lastly, leave them in a cup to dry completely.</p>
		<h2>Palette</h2>
		<p>If you are finished and satisfied with your painting, and you are not planning to use paints within about two weeks, then you should wipe all the paints off the palette with a towel. Then, wash it with water and soap, but if it's difficult to wash it, use a paint thinner to wipe it with a towel. Dry it afterward.</p><p>However, if you plan to use the paints again, place the palette in a sealed container. Be aware of it becoming hardened on the outside after several days, but when you tear the "skin" and add slight oil inside if needed and use paint underneath, paint is as good as new!</p>
		<h2>Palette Knives</h2>
		<p>You can simply wipe extra paint off the plate knives with a towel. After that, wash them with water and soap, then and leave them to dry if you want. A paint thinner is not needed.</p>
