		<h2>Who Invented Oil Paint</h2>
		<p>While many people believe that the van Eyck brothers invented oil paints in Northern Europe in 1420 before oil paints became popularly used and elevated by the famous painters in the Northern Renaissance, the inventor of oil painting is unknown, but oils had been added to paint mixtures before oil paint became a medium. The earliest known paint with oil is recorded from as early as the 11th century. Theophilus Presbyter's work was identified as a paint used linseed oil with lime and the work was dated to about 1125. There is a painted crucifix with evidence of oils being used from the ancient stave church at Hemse, Sweden was created in about 1180. At Tingelstad in Norway, there is a painted altar in the church that was believed to be used with oil, and it was dated to about 1300. Since there are some different shreds of evidence that show oil paints existed before the van Eyck brothers' time, scientists and researchers are still not able to find the original inventor of oil paint.</p>

		<h2>How did Oil Painting Develop</h2>
		<p>The development of oil paint has been identified in the Early Renaissance in Northern Europe and Italy. The artists from these areas had been experimenting with paint using different techniques and materials, and they found that using oil as a pigment binder was better than tempera. Tempera was the main panel painting before oil paint. Eventually, oil paint became more preferred. However, some artists like Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci continued to use the combination of these mediums.</p>
