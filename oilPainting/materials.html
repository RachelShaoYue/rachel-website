		<h2>Materials</h2>
		<p>There are some materials that beginners should have to start painting their artworks. You can buy cheap materials, but there are some slight expensive things they should get to maintain their painting brushes and paint in good conditions. Some materials are not a must, but they are recommended to keep things organized and tidy.</p>

		<h2>Oil Paint</h2>
		<p>For the start, <a href="http://www.winsornewton.com/na/shop/oil-colour/oil-colour-sets/winton-oil-colour-10-x-37ml-tube-set-1490619">a set of 10 oil paints from Winsor and Newton</a> is recommended. You might want to buy more white oil paint if you plan to learn how to rely on mixing oil paints as white is used a lot in that process. You should have primary colors and second colors. They provide various excellent colors when you mix them. You should be always experimenting with blending and mixing oil paints.</p>
		<h2>Painting Brushes</h2>
		<p>You don't need many various paintbrushes as you need to learn how to use some paintbrushes comfortable. Flat, round, and filbert are some different brushes you should get. If you are planning to paint on a large canvas, then you should get a huge flat paintbrush to make the process faster. Using a flat paintbrush, you can fill a color inside a geometric space or paint a straight line. A round paintbrush is good for making detail or bold strokes. Many artists like to use a filbert brush a lot because it is not too flat or too round. It's in the middle, and it's great for blending paints and making soft edges.</p>
		<h2>Turpentine</h2>
		<p>You will be needing this paint thinner a lot for cleaning or washing your brushes. Turpentine is the most commonly used compared to other paint thinners because it is an effective paint solvent to remove paint from various types of surfaces. Please be aware of its toxicity. It's flammable and can be irritating to eyes, nose, and throat. Try to avoid inhaling it because it can cause headaches, nausea, or other unwanted reactions. After you are done with it, please dispose of it at a hazardous waste facility. However, it can be reused in different ways. After you use it, you can just leave it in a sealed container until paint particles settle down, and then you can reuse the top, it will be clear, of it.</p>
		<h2>Newspaper</h2>
		<p>Planning to throw newspaper out after reading it? Fortunately for you and the earth, you are going to recycle them; you can use them to prevent oil paints from messing or dripping onto your table or surface. You can wipe your brush on it before dipping it into another paint. Make sure that your newspaper is folded once or more to prevent oil from getting through to a surface. You can keep reuse it until it becomes covered by paint.</p>
		<h2>Linseed Oil</h2>
		<p>You would need oil or any type of oil to use as a paint binder, but linseed oil is the most used oil because it's easy to manipulate paints. It is also a fast-drying oil. Oil is used to thin paints and make them easier to blend with other paints, or it can be used to make paints more transparent for an effect. As more oil is added to your painting, more wrinkled it becomes. Be aware that some color paints have more oil than other colors. For example, Burnt Umber, Cobalt Blue, and Burnt Sienna dry faster than Sap Green, Cadmium colors, and other reds. There are some ways to speed up the drying such as using a paint thinner or an alkyd medium.</p>
		<h2>Pencil</h2>
		<p>It would not be necessary if you want to paint it without any preparation. A pencil is used to sketch a drawing on the painting before you start to add paints and colors. If you are not confident with your drawing skill, then you can trace an image on your painting, using a projector or a tracing paper. I would highly recommend you to sketch your painting with a pencil because if you make some mistakes while you are painting, you will have to leave them to dry for while before you could fix it. Sketching your painting helps you to minimize your mistakes.</p>
		<h2>Palette</h2>
		<p>Palette is essential to place your paints. You also would use it to mix paints or add more oil to them. If you want to have a reusable palette, then you need to buy a palette that does not absorb oil paints. The non-absorbable palette can be made of plastic, melamine, or wooden rubbed with oil. There are two types of palettes. One of them is set on a table and it does not have a hole. Another one has a hole that allows you to hold it comfortably while you are painting.</p>
		<h2>Easel</h2>
		<p>You could put your painting on the table, but since you don't face straight to your painting, you would distort your painting. When you are done painting it and set it up on the standing, it would look weird with a different angle and perspective. Therefore, an easel helps you to paint on your painting that will look good with the facing perspective. You will have to find the right easel that will set the painting on the same level as your eye. There are several different sizes of easel; you need to choose the right easel that is suitable for your position while painting. However, you can buy an easel that can be resized for any position.</p>
		<h2>Canvas</h2>
		<p>During the Renaissance, oil paintings are often created on wooden panels, but since artists find a canvas to be more portable, lighter, and flexible, they start to paint on them instead. There are some considerations needed before buying a canvas because the right type of canvas is depending on how each artist creates their oil painting and their painting techniques. There are several different fabrics and textures to choose from. Canvas made of linen was introduced before cotton. Cotton fabric is softer and easier to stretch. Since linen canvas is more durable and Linen canvas is more durable and higher rigidity, it is more expensive than cotton canvas. Bumpier the texture is, less will it show the strokes of using oil painting brushes. Also, you have to decide whether you want your canvas to be primed or not. For the start, having a primed canvas is highly recommended. The higher amount of primer you put on your canvas will increase the absorbency of oil color, decreasing its glossiness and brightness. There are two common kinds of fabric used for creating oil paintings.</p>
