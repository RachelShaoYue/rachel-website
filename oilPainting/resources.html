		<h2>Additional Information</h2>
		<h3>Link to My Homepage</h3>
		<p>There is a blue link to my homepage in the footer.</p>
		<h3>My Logo</h3>
		<p>The logo displayed on all pages is created on Adobe Illustrator. I created this logo to symbolize the content of my website and the letter of my first name.</p>
		<h3>Embedded Media</h3>
		<p>I used iframe code for each of three videos from YouTube to show some techniques used in oil painting. And all of them are located on the Techniques page.</p>
		<h3>Rollover Effect</h3>
		<p>All of the images located on the History page use the roller effect of fading.</p>
		<h3>My Website</h3>
		<p>I feel that I have done well on making the media queries for each device - mobile, tablet, and desktop. I made sure that the images several screen widths, so that they won't be overflowing the box or skewed. I also think I like how content is divided into boxes with a shadow when a device or tablet mode is used, and then it won't show any shadow on mobile. I believe that I did well at designing an logo that suits the content of my website and fits in the navigation bar.</p>
		<p>There are many factors that I want to improve my website, but there are two of them I feel are much necessary to be fixed. I suspect that too many pictures will be annoying when viewing them on mobile because viewers would have to scroll the screen too much. Maybe I should put all images of artists and their artworks into one slideshow somewhere on the History tag. Another one, the navigation tabs on mobile should be merged into one bar. I planned to use w3schools' <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp">Mobile Navigation Menu</a>, but I dropped this plan because it was difficult to keep the tabs arranged horizontally when the website is viewed on a desktop or tablet. Also, I already designed how tags should be arranged before I got the idea of using Mobile Navigation Menu, so I found it tough to redesign how it should look.</p>
