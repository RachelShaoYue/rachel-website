	<h1>Rachel Taylor</h1>

	<div>

		<p>Hello! My name is Rachel Taylor, a current third year student at Rochester Institute of Technology. Last year,
			I have declared my major in Software Engineering after taking the Computing Exploration Program which provides different
			computing related classes. Since I kept web developing somewhere in my heart from the exploration program, I have recently decided
			to study Web Development as my minor. I am excited to keep digging deeper into the technical world and sharpening my coding skills in
			both front and back ends.</p>

		<p>With this portfolium site, I hope this site will help you to know who I am and what I am interested in better.
			Not only that, it also will help me to organize and understand where my interests and limits lay.</p>

		<h1>Education</h1>

			<p>I went to Kansas School for the Deaf (KSD) when I was four years old, and then I graduated and earned a
				high school diploma from there. Also, I attended a public school for other classes, starting in my sixth
				grade; I was a part-time student at both of the schools.</P>

			<p>At KSD, I had participated in several extracurriculars, including Academic Bowl, American Sign Language Bowl,
				and Oratorical competitions. I also played volleyball, and track and field.</p>

			<p>After graduating, I started attending RIT, and I took the Computing Exploration program for the first year.
				After taking several various computing related classes, I have decided to study Software Engineering as my
				major</p>

		<h1>Personal</h1>

			<p>During my free time, I mostly like to watch movies or TV shows on Netflix. However, on a good day, I enjoy
				reading fantasy and mystery books. If I have a lot of free time, I love to make an oil painting or some artworks.
				Also, I love traveling around the world like my family does.</p>
			
			<p>Almost every summer, we go on a vacation in different states to see the beauty of nature. We have been
				to most of the western states of the U.S. Those states are excellent to witness how amazing nature is. If
				you wonder that I have went abroad to a foreign country; well, I have been in China, but that was because
				I was born there. If you have guessed correctly; yes, I was adopted. I hope that in the future I could visit
				my previous homeland.</p>

		<h1>Oil Painting as My Hobby</h1>

			<p>I have discovered that I really love do some oil paintings when I took a studio arts class in my public
				school. Before that, I liked to draw something with pencils and pens as I always have been since I was
				very young. I had never tried making oil paintings until I took that class. When I tried to paint one, I
				realized that I really liked to blend colors and showed them on a canvas, and it was fantastic to see the
				result after I added several layers of colors to it after several days. However, it required a lot of
				patience because an oil paint took long to dry. Nevertheless, the colors of it brought the painting to life
				which was not like drawing with graphite pencils and ink pens. As a result, I took an oil painting class and
				loved it. As that being said, I hope someday I could take an oil painting class here at RIT if they have it.
